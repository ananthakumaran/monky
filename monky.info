Staging and Committing
**********************

*Changes* section will list all the changes in the repo. Using
monky you can select a subset of your changes and commit it. Type
`s' to stage a file. Typing `S' will stage all files.

*Staged Changes* section will list all the staged changes in the
repo. Type `u' to unstage a file. Typing `U' will unstage all the
previously staged files.

Once you staged all the necessary files type `c'. This will pop-up a
buffer for the commit message. Typing `C-c C-c' will commit all the
staged files.

Hg doesn't have any staging area. So staging and unstaging won't make
any changes to your repo unless you commit.

Merged Files
************

After a merge, this section will list the files merged. Typing `m'
will mark the file as resolved and `x' will mark the file as
unresolved. After a merge, Hg doesn't allows to commit a subset of
changes. so files can't be staged or unstaged. So committing after a
merge will commit all the merged and unmodified files during the
merge.

next commit. Type `RET' to see the commit information.
