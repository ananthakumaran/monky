the status of the hg repo. The status buffer list down the missing
files, untracked files and changed files.

5 Staging and Committing
************************

_Changes_ section will list all the changes in the repo. Using monky
you can select a subset of your changes and commit it. Type `s' to
stage a file. Typing `S' will stage all files.

Typing `TAB' will toggle the diff view for a changed file.

   _Staged Changes_ section will list all the staged changes in the
repo. Type `u' to unstage a file. Typing `U' will unstage all the
previously staged files.

   Once you staged all the necessary files type `c'. This will pop-up a
buffer for the commit message. Typing `C-c C-c' will commit all the
staged files.

   Hg doesn't have any staging area. So staging and unstaging won't make
any changes to your repo unless you commit.

6 Merged Files
**************

After a merge, this section will list the files merged. Typing `m' will
mark the file as resolved and `x' will mark the file as unresolved.
After a merge, Hg doesn't allows to commit a subset of changes. so
files can't be staged or unstaged. So committing after a merge will
commit all the merged and unmodified files during the merge.
