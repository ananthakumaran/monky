Monky provides an interactive interface for Hg.

## Installation

````cl
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/monky/dir")
(require 'monky)

;; By default monky spawns a seperate hg process for every command.
;; This will be slow if the repo contains lot of changes.
;; if `monky-process-type' is set to cmdserver then monky will spawn a single
;; cmdserver and communicate over pipe.
;; Available only on mercurial versions 1.9 or higher

(setq monky-process-type 'cmdserver)

````

## Usage

open any file in a hg repo and run `M-x monky-status` to see the
current status. Look at the [documentation][monky-documentation] for further details.
